                    <h4>Growing need for cloud computing system protection</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cyber security is a salient and evolving issue in the digital world. Both companies and users are victims of cyber security crises. Customers lose their right to protect personal information in many cases. In Adidas data breach, the limited data including
                        contact information, usernames, and encrypted passwords were leaked. Financial loss is another tremendous disadvantage for companies. In one data breach, Capital One agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after
                        a hacker broke into its cloud-computing systems. Although cyber security is a growing need with a blooming market size in the following decades, the supply of technology and professionalism is not adequate. Global cyber security
                        market is valued at USD 139.77 billion in 2021, and the estimated market is projected to grow from USD 155.83 billion in 2022 to USD 376.32 billion by 2029. With the prosperous future of the cyber security market, the technology
                        and professionalism to protect cloud computing systems is in shortage. Despite rapid adoption of cloud computing, security remains a primary issue for cloud customers. Virtually all surveyed cybersecurity professionals (96%) confirm
                        they are at least moderately concerned about public cloud security, a small increase from last year’s survey.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Wasted time and labor in manually implementing the code</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the past, policy protecting clouding computing systems like writing credentials, creating automated controls to protect Kubernetes workloads was manually implemented and regulated by staff in the company. Although it was logical to use a certain amount
                        of time and labor to manually implement cyber security codes for special occasions, it was still unnecessary for the repeated procedures. Implementing the codes can be a slow, tedious, and fatiguing process. Such work is not a
                        labor-saving workflow, but also an inefficient investment for a company. Staff need to be trained in the review process and must be available to perform reviews. It can take a full year of experience before an engineer is ready
                        to effectively perform manual secure code reviews.

                    <p>To prevent malicious actions or attacks on you or your company’s cloud system and documents, you would need secure ways to protect it. Our product will create an automatic preventive control to protect your system. </p>
                    <p>Once you have everything set up, our server will be able to detect the violations or malicious actions in your system based on the policies. You could choose to use policies from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
                        or we could help you make your own custom policy as code. Any action that's violating the policy you chose will be stopped and warnings will be sent back to you.</p>
